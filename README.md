# MajorProject-Music-Platform

There's a massive amount of talent in India, especially in music. But this art rarely ever gets a platform to showcase itself. Artists are recognized less than they should be, for the work they put into their art. This project intends to develop a platform for talented artists in India, supporting their future work and rewarding their skills, unlike many of the other competitors.
The aim of this project is to develop a cloud-based web platform for audio streaming and uploading. The platform will also feature authentication, and AI models for improving User Experience such as Song Recommendations, and Comment filtering based on vulgarity. The web application will have a serverless backend using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the AWS Amplify framework. This will allow for scalability and efficient data fetching as well as upload.
